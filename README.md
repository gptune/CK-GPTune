# ck-gptune
CK for GPTune

This repository contains a CK module called gptune that provides a number of
dummy actions to use GPTune workflows (e.g. autotuning with or without history
database).

We (will) also provide some applications in the program directory to test and
evalaute with GPTune.

Note: as of now, we do not automate GPTune installation. Here, we assumes GPTune
and required software are installed correctly. And, please make sure that the
environment variable "PYTHONPATH" includes all required Python code (e.g.
GPTune, mpi4py, scikit-optimize, and autotune).
