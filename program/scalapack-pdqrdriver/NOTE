Currently the installation ($ ck compile ck-gptune:program:scalapack-pdqrdriver)
of scalapack pdqrdriver is done as part of the gptune installation.

We may not need to install whole gptune framework for this pdqrdriver example,
because we can install the GPTune framework using the gptune package with
command $ ck install ck-gptune:package:gptune.

But, as of now we install the whole package for a quick development.
We can consider this issue later.
